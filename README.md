# Healthcare Appointment Booking App

This is a simple frontend app for booking doctor appointments. I built it using React and styled it with Tailwind CSS. The app lets users view available doctors, check their details, and book appointments.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- React.js – for building the UI
- React Router – for page navigation
- Tailwind CSS – for quick styling
- Free doctor images for display

## Challenges and How I Solved Them

**1. Routing Between Pages**  
At first, setting up routes between home, doctor profile, and booking confirmation pages wasn’t smooth. I used React Router’s dynamic routing to get it working properly.



**2. Showing Availability**  
I wanted to show whether a doctor is available or not. I added a field in the mock data and displayed status using simple conditional rendering in the UI.

## What I’d Improve With More Time

- Add a backend (maybe Flask or Node.js) to save and manage real appointments.
- Let users pick time slots from a calendar.
- Add authentication so patients can sign in and view their bookings.
- Better search and filter options on the home page.
- Responsive design improvements for smaller screens.
- Proper form validation and maybe a confirmation message or email after booking.
